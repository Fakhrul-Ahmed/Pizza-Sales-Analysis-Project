# Data Analysis: Excel-SQL-Power BI
## Project Name: Pizza Sales Analysis
## Overview
The Pizza Sales Analysis project is an end-to-end data analysis initiative aimed at deriving meaningful insights from pizza sales data. Using a combination of tools including Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI, the project demonstrates how to analyze data, process it effectively, and create impactful visualizations.
## Project Workflow
The project is divided into two main parts: Data Analysis in MS SQL Server and Visualization in Power BI.
### Part 1: MS SQL Server
Import Raw Data: Loaded raw pizza sales data into MS SQL Server.
Creating Database: Organized the data into a structured database.
Writing SQL Queries: Executed queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs).
Creating Report: Generated intermediate results to aid further analysis.
### Part 2: Power BI
Connecting to MS SQL Server: Established a connection to retrieve processed data.
Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset was free of inconsistencies.
Data Processing: Leveraged DAX functionalities for advanced calculations.
Data Visualization: Designed comprehensive charts and dashboards.
Report/Dashboard: Created an interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project was to analyze pizza sales data and derive actionable insights. Specifically, we aimed to compute the following metrics and create corresponding visualizations:
### KPIs Requirement:
Total Revenue
Average Order Value
Total Pizzas Sold
Total Orders
Average Pizzas Per Order
### Charts Requirement:
Daily Trend for Total Orders
Monthly Trend for Total Orders
Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
Top 5 Best Sellers (Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders)
Bottom 5 Worst Sellers (Revenue, Total Quantity, Total Orders)
## Tools and Software Used
MS Office/Excel: Initial data exploration and preparation.
MS SQL Server: Data processing and querying.
SQL Server Management Studio: Query execution and database management.
Power BI: Visualization and dashboard creation.
## Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard showcases:
Interactive charts and visuals.
Clear trends and patterns in pizza sales performance.
Insights into best- and worst-performing products to guide business decisions.
## How to Access
Clone this repository.
Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.
Use the included SQL scripts to replicate the database and queries.
## Future Scope
Expand analysis to include customer demographics.
